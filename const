The const can be on either side of the data type so:

“const int *” is same as “int const *”

“const int * const” is same as “int const * const”

int *ptr;           // ptr is pointer to int
int const *ptr;     // ptr is pointer to const int
int * const ptr;        // ptr is const pointer to int
int const * const ptr;  // ptr is const pointer to const int
int ** const ptr;       // ptr is const pointer to a pointer to an int
int * const *ptr;       // ptr is pointer to a const pointer to an int
int const **ptr;        // ptr is pointer to a pointer to a const int
int * const * const ptr;    // ptr is const pointer to a const pointer to an int
The basic rule is const applies to the thing left of it. If there is nothing on the left then it applies to the thing right of it.
